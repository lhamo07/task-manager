        Welcome to the Todo App! This application helps you manage your tasks
        efficiently by allowing you to add, update, complete todos. It&apos;s
        designed to be simple, fast, and user-friendly.
      </p>

        The app uses React for the frontend and integrates with Airtable for
        storing todos securely. It demonstrates modern React features such as
        hooks, context, and reducer patterns for state management.
